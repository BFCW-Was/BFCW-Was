# 👋 Hi there!
I'm a Chilean **Full Stack Developer** passionate about building *efficient* and *scalable* solutions to innovative problems.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
I work mainly with **JavaScript**, **Dart**, **Python**, and modern frameworks like **Vue 3**, **Flutter**, **Flask**, and **Node.js**.  
Being *curious by nature*, I often use this space to experiment, test ideas, and stay sharp.

🔒 Most of my professional projects live in **private repositories** linked to company-specific profiles, but my passion for clean, maintainable, and scalable code is definitely well known.

## 📊 GitHub Stats
I'll leave my stats here with the hope that, in the future, they might reflect some of my private work — for now, they don’t make much sense 😣

</p>

## 🚀 Current Project
🔭 I'm currently working on a personal project called **Turin** with [Ashly Mazuela](https://github.com/AshlyMazuelaAvalos) — an application designed to highlight *lesser-known tourist spots* in (for now) Chile.
> Turin aims to support **local tourism** by helping users discover hidden gems and build *personalized travel routes*. Coming soon!

## ⚡ Fun Facts
- When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me **exploring indie games** or playing something on **Steam** (my second IDE) 😶‍🌫️  
- I hope to launch a game someday!
