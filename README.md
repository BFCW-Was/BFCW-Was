# 🫡 Hi there!
I'm a Chilean **Full Stack Developer** passionate about building *efficient* and *scalable* solutions to innovative challenges.

*Curious by nature* I often use this space to experiment, test ideas, and stay sharp.

> 💼 My portfolio is in [here](https://bfcw-was.github.io/Portfolio/)!

## ⚙️ Technical Check ⚙️

## 📈 GitHub Stats 📉
I'll leave my stats here with the hope that, in the future, they might reflect some of my private work. For now, they don’t make much sense 😣

> 🔐 Most of my professional projects live in **private repositories** linked to company-specific profiles, but my passion for clean, maintainable, and scalable code is definitely well known.

## 🚧 Ongoing Project 🚧
I'm currently working on a personal project called **Turin** with [Ashly Mazuela](https://github.com/AshlyMazuelaAvalos) — an application designed to highlight *lesser-known touristic spots* in, for now, Chile.

- Turin aims to support **local tourism** by helping users discover hidden gems and build *personalized travel routes*.

> Coming soon!

## ⚡ Fun Facts ⚡
- When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me **exploring indie games** or playing something on **Steam** (my second IDE) 😶‍🌫️  
- I hope to launch a game someday! ⌨️🎮🕹️
- My dream has always been to work as a detective 🍮 or any kind of investigation, although I only recently discovered it, it made a lot of things make sense.
- Im fluent in English y en Español.
